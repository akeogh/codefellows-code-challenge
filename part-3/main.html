    <h1>Welcome to the Library Version 2!</h1>

    <p>Let's take a look at the <span class="code">Book, Shelf,</span> and <span class="code">Library</span> modules. We'll display some information here, but behind the scenes, lots of other stuff will be going on.</p>

    <p>First, let's look at the <span class="code">"Book"</span> object. We'll create some books, then use their <span class="code">toString()</span> method to present the details:</p>

    <div id = "bookSection" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>Sweet!</figcaption>

    <p>Now we'll add the books to a <span class="code">Shelf</span>. We'll use the shelf's <span class="code">toString()</span> method to show its contents.</p>

    <div id = "addToShelf" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>...Well that"s basically just the same</figcaption>

    <p>Okay. Maybe not that exciting. But what about removing a book? We can use the <span class = "code">removeBook()</span> function to do just that!</p>

    <div id = "removeFromShelf" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>WHAT WHERE DID THOSE BOOKS GO?</figcaption>

    <p>Now we"re getting somewhere! The shelf's <span class "code">toString()</span> function removes books by title, so it's easy to use. But just one shelf isn't that exciting. I'd much prefer...</p>

    <div id = "library" class "code"></div>
    <figcaption>A LIBRARY!</figcaption>

    <p>Alright, a lot went on behind the scenes there. Now we have a library, with a few shelves, a few books on those shelves... But wait! A new shipment just came in! Let's add them to our inventory and get 'em on the shelves. You can create a new book with the Library object and put it directly on a shelf - let's add "The Maltese Falcon" to shelf 1:</p>

    <div id = "newBooks" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>Such a great story!</figcaption>

    <p>Oh no! Shelf 3 had a moldy book! We'll have to get rid of the entire shelf!</p>

    <div id = "removeShelf" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>RIP, Shelf.</figcaption>

    <p>A library isn't just about books on shelves. You gotta be able to check them out:</p>

    <div id = "checkOut" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>Wow. We're for real now.</figcaption>

    <p>And of course, check them back in!</p>

    <div id = "checkIn" class = "code"></div>
    <figcaption>Love to have all my books in a row!</figcaption>

    <p>So there you are kids. That's what a library was like, back in the days before your newfangled Kindles and e-Book readers.</p>
